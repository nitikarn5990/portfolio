					<p>The website is designed with open data in mind. Every dynamic data are fetched by open, documented API. All dynamic content are rendered by AngularJS on the frontend. The site is also marked with <a href="http://schema.org">schema.org</a> markup and email communication has iCalendar event file.</p>
					<p>During the event the website ran smoothly with no downtime even with over 2,000 visitors as the site hosts static contents at GitHub pages while my server only handle dynamic contents.</p>

					<p>The backend use a job queue to allow distribution of grading job over several machines (over 5 are used during SOSCamp). Each grading job spawns new Docker container to run untrusted code so that users may submit code using fork that some variants of grading sandbox disallowed such system calls.</p>

The game is a clone of the famous snake game featured in old Nokia phones, but with several things added on top; you compete with other players for highest score achieved when others rammed into you and there will be items that, when collected, cause special effects to your snake or other snakes such as inverting controls or being able to bite other snakes temporary.</p>

Later, an optional extension was created named Twitica Desktop+ that removed the need for API proxy.

					<p>Twitica Desktop use many HTML5 features, such as CSS3 Animations, CSS 3D Transformation, Web Worker, XMLHttpRequest 2, HTML5 File Drag &amp; Drop.</p>
					<p>Twitica Desktop is now being used by over 200 users and being rewritten from scratch to be more optimized and customizable. The concept behind this is to bring mobile Twitter client experience to the desktop, and become configurable and programmable.</p>

					<p>The first version of willwillBot was created around 2007 using PHP. It was an IRC Bot using heavily modified version of theDtTvB's IRC bot framework. The source code was very messy, so I created the second version of the bot in Python. The feature set is not the same, and they was designed to be able to live in the same IRC channel without problem.</p>
					<p>The third version of bot does not have much bells and whistles of the older versions. It runs on XChat's Python scripting engine. The bot allowed users to create, run and save custom Python with Jinja2 template code. Each user had their own RPython sandbox and each channel also had theirs. The wiki then can be viewed via Redmine. However, an incident happened and I lost the source code for every version except for version 1 which was open sourced for a while.</p>
					<p>Version 3 of the bot then was reused for a new bot which was aimed for human-friendliness. Commands is issued in Thai directly to the bot just like mentioning any other IRC user. No more !command. In case of ambiguity, the bot tries to guess the correct command.</p>
					<p>The bot then was cloned to JavaScript and runs under Node.js and became @willwillBot on Twitter. The user stream engine was detached afterwards and became Twitica Engine. One of the most popular features of the bot are คำผวน (spoonerism) and Thai-English keyboard layout switch.</p>

						Marketing the launch of a highly anticipated game Portal 2, Valve cooperated with indie game developers to create an ARG. (Alternate Reality Game) The ARG starts on 1 April 2011. On that day, various indie games have been updated. Players found that new, out of place stuff have been added to the games that could form cryptic clues that ultimately leads to <a href="http://www.aperturescience.com/glados@home/">GLaDOS@Home</a>.
					</p>
					<p>
						During the ARG, events were recorded in the <a href="http://valvearg.com">ValveARG wiki</a>. After the ARG have ended, one of the key player decided to ask the community to create a thank you page. Few days have passed with no news from the team. On April 22<sup>nd</sup> 2011, a countdown appeared on ValveARG.com. Press guessed it was a countdown to a DLC. After the countdown ended, people start flooding the message board with thank you messages to Valve. Over 1,722 people have shown their gratitude on the message board. The thank you messages were read by the indie developers and Valve.

						My school wanted to show students' exam score as soon as possible as they're already using machines to process the answer cards. This application have evolved from the first version that used MooTools and supported only Internet Explorer (as Internet Explorer is the only browser that can read AJAX data in the correct encoding) to the second version, using jQuery UI and the character encoding is handled server-side.
					</p>
					<p>In 2009, Minprasat Wittaya school's teachers visited my school and asked for the source code of the system. They're using it to show their students' grades online.</p>
					<p>In 2013, I rewrote the entire system due to security breach and load problems. The new system use only static JSON files. It also have Facebook share and Twitter post features. I also documented its API for future teachers and students.</p>
